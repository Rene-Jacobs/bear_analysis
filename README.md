# Black Bear Body Weight Analysis Repository
This GitHub repository contains an analysis of data taken from the article "Estimating the Live Body_weight of American Black Bears in Florida." The analysis focuses on the relationship between chest_girth and body_weight of black bears. The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed overview of the data analysis process, including data collection, descriptive statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and linear regression.

## Data Source
The data used in this analysis is sourced from the article "Estimating the Live Body_weight of American Black Bears in Florida." Specifically, we will be using the variables "chest_girth" and "Body_weight" from the dataset "bear_statistics_cleaned.csv."

## Analysis Process
The analysis in this repository will follow the following steps:
1. Data Collection: We collected a sample of 100 male bears and 100 female bears from the dataset "bear_statistics_cleaned.csv " to analyze the relationship between chest girth and body weight. The details of how these samples were collected will be described in the code file.
2. Descriptive Statistics and Visualization: The code will generate a visual distribution and calculate summary statistics for the variables "chest_girth" and "body_weight." This will provide insights into the characteristics of each variable.
3. Scatter Plot: A scatter plot of the sample pairs of chest_girth and body_weight will be created. The visual correlation will be assessed, and its strength (strong, moderate, weak), direction (positive or negative), and reasons for this correlation will be explained.
4. Correlation Coefficient: We will find the correlation coefficient, which will offer insights into the relationship between bear chest size and weight. We will support our conclusions with statistical reasoning and discuss how the graph created in step 2 supports or contradicts these conclusions.
5. Linear Regression Equation: The linear regression equation will be derived to model the relationship between chest size and weight. The meaning of the terms B0 and B1 in the equation with respect to chest size and weight will be explained. The Coefficient of Determination will be discussed in terms of its relationship to the linear regression equation.

Please note that this README.md file provides an overview of the analysis process, and the detailed analysis can be found in the code file within this repository. The final results, including findings and conclusions, will be compiled into a comprehensive report.
